# GraphQL CMS Excercise
A NodeJS app built for a coding challenge based on the creation of a simplistic graphql based CMS.

## Install:
Checkout the repository, and then:
```bash
$ yarn install
```
*Note: yarn is currently being used for scripts inside of package.json. If you prefer npm, you'll need to edit the "start" script to use "npm run" instead of "yarn".

## Tests:
```bash
$ yarn test # Run unit tests
# or
$ yarn _test # Run unit tests and output coverage
# or
$ yarn test-dev # Run unit tests and watch for file changes
```

## Check flow-typing:
```bash
$ yarn run flow 
```

## Run:
```bash
$ yarn start # Startup the app
```
